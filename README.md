How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The unit test ensure that my code is functional. The test have 100% code coverage ensuring each line of the files is executed at least once and that they behave as expected. The constraints on the objects ensure that no unexpected input is accepted making the code more secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are interpreted as requirements. These requirements are the foundation of my test cases ensuring they are present in the code.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software in a systematic way. First I identify the requirements then develop code and tests fufillling these requirements examining the process as I progress.
